    functionOption: 19

  - tutorialDialog: It's time for ~Conditionals~!
    functionOption: 13
  - tutorialDialog: Your new blocks are IF and ENDIF. They work together! You can
      use them with the behaviors you already have.
    functionOption: 18
  - tutorialDialog: With the IF block, we can choose to follow a set of behaviors
      if a chosen condition is met.
    functionOption: 18
  - tutorialDialog: Any behaviors placed after the IF block will only be executed
      if the condition is met!
    functionOption: 18
  - tutorialDialog: Don't forget to place an ENDIF block at the end of the condition.
    functionOption: 18
  - tutorialDialog: But how can we use these to attack every single enemy?
    functionOption: 7
  - tutorialDialog: Maybe we can make a warrior that turns to face an enemy if they're
      not already facing one, and move in that direction.
