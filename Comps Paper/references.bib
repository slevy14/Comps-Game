	abstract = {The paper discusses the criteria about how one can establish if a group is a new genre. It distinguishes between two main lines of thinking about genre in general – content and discourse. Both lines have two things to discuss. For content it is similarities and differences in mechanics, and for discourse it is commercial and social purpose of the use of new categories. The case studies then show how this can be applied to the rising autobattler class. There are 7 core mechanics in games that are similar, but every game differs in small details from others. The discourse in the social and commercial sphere has appeared over a short time period, and the adoption of the new genre by the gaming community was therefore fast. The bottom line of the text is that using rigid categories for discussions about digital games cannot focus only on rigid criteria, but also on context.},

	abstract = {The use of games in education has become an increasingly present practice in contemporary society. For so-called "digital natives", learning through electronic games becomes more significant. Digital educational games are often seen as boring, non-motivational, that fail to bring in some essential elements that promote engagement, making the learning goal is not achieved either. Game Design is a game project. It describes how the game should be, defining its mechanics and interactions between player and the virtual world of the game and how they can affect the game environment. In order to document the design of a game, there is the Game Design Document ({GDD}), whose one of the main objectives, besides registration, is to help in communication between the different production teams of a game, allowing the game designer a broad view of that is being produced. However, because it is a large document that brings in detail all the main elements for the production of a game, it turns out to be little used, especially if the focus is the elaboration of small games, which are the majority of the digital educational games that exist. For these short games, which can often be worked out within a few hours, there are Short Game Design Document ({SGDD}). The {SGDD}, unlike {GDD}, will describe the elements of the game in a simplified way possible, whereas the game to be drawn from it is also a simple game. Thus, the proposal of this work is to elaborate a model of {SGDD} for educational games (the {SGDDEdu}), specifying elements of art, sound, mechanics and game programming, as well as educational elements in accordance with the new {BNCC} (National Curricular Common Base) of Elementary School, so that there is a standardization and better categorization of educational games aligned with the proposed pedagogical objectives and the skills and competences described in each level of education. This work will be developed from the study and analysis of some models of already existing {SGDD} and the {BNCC} of Elementary School in general, causing in {SGDDEdu}. The research will be applied with teachers and educators requesting that they specify an educational game in the {SGDDEdu} template. With this, we intend to verify if the {SGDDEdu} has relevance and if it facilitates in the production of digital educational games, providing the teaching and learning process through the games, as well as trying to identify how the {NCCB} can contribute in the development of educational games.

	abstract = {Coding games are widely used to teach computational thinking ({CT}). Studies have broadly investigated the role of coding games in supporting {CT} learning in formal classroom contexts, but there has been limited exploration of their use in informal home-based settings. This study investigated the factors that motivated students to use a coding game called Coding Galaxy in a home-based setting. It explored the connections between the students’ perceptions of and usage of the tool. An 11-day intervention was conducted at a primary school in Hong Kong with 104 participants. The students’ perceptions of the game were collected via questionnaires and information on their use of the tool was extracted from log files. Results indicated that coding motivation and feeling of enjoyment were predictors of the actual use of the game, with coding motivation the dominant factor. Focus group interviews were also conducted to further explore the students’ motivation to play the game. Through comparisons of active and inactive users, the qualitative findings supported the quantitative results, indicating that students who were more intrinsically motivated tended to be more active in using the game. The implications of the study for researchers and practitioners in {CT} education are discussed.},

	shorttitle = {Three Paradigms for Mixing Coding and Games},
	abstract = {Games for teaching coding have been an educational holy grail since at least the early 1980s. Yet for decades, with games more popular than ever and with the need to teach kids coding having been well-recognized, no blockbuster coding games have arisen (see Chapter 2). Over the years, the research community has made various games for teaching computer science: a survey made by shows that most do not teach coding, and of the ones that do teach coding, most are research prototypes (not production-ready) and difficult to even install. In analysing the list, we found that some were no longer available, of none were blockbusters (see Chapter 2). With decades of unimpressive performance behind us, it is time to take a critical look at the field and ask some key questions: What is a coding game? Why are there no blockbuster coding games? What design guidelines can make it easier to create coding games? How can we categorize past and future work on coding games into a productive taxonomy? What (if anything) makes coding games difficult to produce? What (if anything) makes them difficult to play? What can/should a ``good'' coding game seek to accomplish? And how can/should we evaluate that?This thesis begins by articulating a design space consisting of 3 types of coding games. The chapters of this thesis examine those three types in the context of systems we built:* Direct embedding -- ``coding in a game". Chapter 3 looks at {CodeSpells}, a game in which the player plays the part of a wizard and writes magic spells with code. The coding interface is embedded in the 3D game. {CodeSpells} is significant because it introduces a novel set of metaphors (magic, wizards, spells, etc.) that correlate neatly with ideas within the pedagogical domain of coding. As an individual system, it is novel because it is the first fantasy-themed coding game (that we know of); as a more general contribution, it is novel because it validates that fantasy-themed coding games can provide an alternative to the more traditional sci-fi themed coding games.* A programming language that is a game -- ``coding as a game". Chapter 4 looks at The Orb Game where a visual programming language is defined as a set of game mechanics, making the process of coding into the process of (seemingly) playing a game. The coding interface is presented as a game. The Orb Game is significant because it is the first system that has been proven to allow players to write code without realizing that they are doing so -- essentially ``tricking'' them into thinking they are just playing a game. It is more generally significant because it introduces a novel technique called Programming by Gaming, which can be used to design other Turing-complete programming environments that appear to be games.* A modding environment integrated with a game -- ``coding for a game". Chapter 5 looks at a modding environment integrated with the blockbuster game of Minecraft. The coding interface allows the user to code for the game. It is significant because it allows players to learn to code in the context of a blockbuster game, resulting in higher recruitment numbers than state of the art coding systems like Scratch. More generally, it proves that loosely-coupled, seamful games may be viable alternatives to the more orthodox style of seamlessly integrated games. This thesis explores this design space and evaluates the three sub-genres above by looking at real systems we built and evaluated. We also discuss our systems in relation to ``adjacent'' systems in the same design space. This analysis, in turn, yields design guidelines that we flesh out in Chapter 6, our concluding chapter.},

Its efficiency, simplicity, and modularity are often highlighted as its strengths compared to other tools. Due to its ubiquity and widespread usage, A* has become a common option for researchers attempting to solve pathfinding problems. However, the sheer amount of research done on the topic makes it difficult to know where to start looking. With this paper, we hope to create an accessible, up to date reference on the current state of the A* search algorithm for future pathfinding projects to consider. This paper examines A-Star’s current usage in the field of pathfinding, comparing A* to other search algorithms. It also analyzes potential future developments for A-Star’s development. A* cannot keep up with the demands of current pathfinding problems. Other algorithms can maintain the same performance while also demanding less overhead and this problem only grows worse as grid size increases. However, use of innovative modifications such as different heuristic types or secondary components to the algorithm allow A* to achieve very fast times with good accuracy when dealing with large maps, while only having slightly increased overhead costs for the modifications. While beginning to show its age, improved algorithms based on the classic A* algorithm are more than capable of keeping up with modern pathfinding demands. These derivative search algorithms such as {HPA}* is used to overcome the limitations of A*. {HPA}* can compete with and even surpass its competitors depending on the challenge faced.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
              Using gamification to support learning in K‐12 education has received much attention from scholars in recent years. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of how gamification should be used to effectively enhance the learning experiences of K‐12 students. The purpose of this review was to synthesize research findings on the use of gamification in K‐12 education and to propose an evidence‐informed framework. This framework will guide teachers and scholars in developing gamified learning environments that are effective in improving K‐12 students' learning. In this regard, 54 empirical studies (out of 907 peer‐reviewed articles), dating from 2008 through 2021, were reviewed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis ({PRISMA}) guideline. The findings were systematically categorized into four essential dimensions of learning environments inspired by Biggs' 3P teaching and learning model, ie, ‘individual factors’, ‘environmental factors’, ‘learning process’ and ‘learning outcome’. The review yielded rich findings concerning each dimension, providing K‐12 teachers and scholars with a comprehensive overview of research findings on using gamification for educational purposes. Meanwhile, the findings indicated the lack of empirical studies regarding constructively aligned gamified courses, in which the different dimensions of the adopted framework are implemented and evaluated coherently. The paper concludes by presenting several suggestions and directions for future research to address this shortcoming.

Adaptive games are considered superior to non-adaptive games, because they constantly assess children's performance, and accordingly adapt the difficulty of the tasks corresponding to the children's individual level. However, empirical evidence with regard to the effectivity of adaptive compared to non-adaptive games is limited. A study was conducted with 191 children from the third year of Kinder garten who were enrolled in one of three conditions, that is, playing an adaptive version of the reading game ({RG}), a non-adaptive version of the {RG} or training with pen-and-paper exercises. In all three conditions, children trained emergent reading (phonological awareness and letter knowledge) once a week for 30 min over a period of 5 weeks. Children's performance on cognitive (phonological awareness, letter knowledge, reading fluency) and non-cognitive (motivation, self-concept) factors was assessed. Results revealed a significant improvement in phonological awareness and letter knowledge in all conditions. However, no differences between the conditions were observed with respect to children's improvement on phonological awareness and letter knowledge or on their post-test scores for reading fluency. With regard to motivation and self-concept, again, no differences in these non-cognitive factors were observed across conditions.},

This article describes lessons learned and a framework for people interested in designing educational games. Although there are many critical components of a quality educational game, a nested model of 6 elements for educational game design is presented. These nested elements are grounded in research and theory in both education and psychology, along with instructional technology and the learning sciences. The 6 elements of educational game design are derived from several studies on game design and development from Grade 5 through graduate school.},

Recently, game researchers have highlighted the need for paying more attention to identifying the game design choices that can strengthen learning. This paper reviews recent studies in the field of games that aim at supporting people with difficulties in learning, particularly in basic reading and maths skills. We identify the major characteristics and learning outcomes of the reviewed studies, as well as key design principles that have been used in games for enhancing basic reading and maths skills. The results show that people with specific learning difficulties have positive improvements in the quality of learning. We also found specific gamification elements that have been used to promote the learning of basic reading and maths skills. However, we call for research, which would explicitly examine the effects of game design choices on learning. Currently, the studies that address learning disabilities do not specifically define which kind of games and game design the results refer to, while game design studies do not clarify how these games influence learning. Thus, there is a need to rethink previous empirical studies on game settings for people with learning difficulties via advancing the role of game design in empirical intervention studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            While gamification and game‐based learning have both been demonstrated to have a host of educational benefits for university students, many university educators do not routinely use these approaches in their teaching. Therefore, this systematic review, conducted using the {PRISMA} guidelines, sought to identify the primary drivers and barriers to the use of gamification and game‐based learning by university educators. A search of multiple databases (Web of Science, Scopus and {EBSCO} (Business Source Complete; {ERIC}; Library, Information Science \& Technology Abstracts)) identified 1330 articles, with 1096 retained after duplicates were removed. Seventeen articles (11 quantitative, two mixed‐methods and four qualitative) were included in the systematic review. The primary drivers described by the educators that positively influenced their gamification and game‐based learning usage were their beliefs that it encourages student interactions and collaborative learning; provides fun and improves engagement; and can easily be used by students. Alternatively, the university educators' major barriers included a lack of time to develop gamification approaches, lack of proven benefits and classroom setting issues. Many of these and other less commonly reported drivers and barriers can be categorised as attitudinal, design‐related or administrative in nature. Such categorisations may assist university educators, teaching support staff and administrators in better understanding the primary factors influencing the utilisation of gamification and game‐based learning and develop more effective strategies to overcome these barriers to its successful implementation.

                        University educators' major drivers that positively influence the use of gamification and game‐based learning include their perceptions that it encourages student interactions and collaborative learning, provides fun and improves engagement and can easily be used by students. 
                       
                       
                        University educators' major barriers that negatively influence the use of gamification and game‐based learning include their perceptions of a lack of time to develop gamification approaches, lack of proven benefits and classroom setting issues.

This study examines the progress made in learning atomic structure by 11 Spanish Students Diagnosed with Learning Difficulties ({SDLD}, experimental group), including those with poor academic performance, specific learning difficulties in reading, writing, and mathematics, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and borderline intellectual disability according to the Spanish curriculum. The study was conducted as part of the Program for Improving Learning and Performance ({PMAR}) and utilized the game “Atomizados”, specifically designed for this purpose. A written test on atomic structure was used to evaluate learning with three learning levels established (naïve, transitional, and informed). The findings indicate that 63.63\% of the {SDLD} (experimental) achieved an informed learning level (understanding the internal structure of the atom) as a result of utilizing a generative learning strategy. The Mann–Whitney U test demonstrated that this learning was statistically significantly greater than that achieved by other students diagnosed with learning difficulties who did not use the game ({SDLD} control group). No significant differences were found between the {SDLD} experimental group and two other groups of grade-9 students with no learning difficulties ({NSDLD} control groups). However, differences were detected between {SDLD} (control) and {NSDLD} (control) in favor of the latter groups. The average for these control groups was a transitional level (identifying some elements of the atomic structure) in the best cases. {SDLD} (experimental) exhibited a very positive perception of the game’s influence on learning chemistry, highlighting its attractiveness, interest, and potential for generating classroom participation.},
