# MAGICODE
**Magicode** is an educational autobattler game designed to teach programming fundamentals. This is my Senior Comprehensive project for Occidental College, created Fall 2024. In this repository you'll find a playable release of the game, alongside its source code and all other relevant material surrounding its development and corresponding academic work.

# Repository Contents
## Playable Release
Head to [Releases](https://github.com/slevy14/Comps-Game/releases) to download the most recent MacOS and Windows builds of the game, or check out my page on [itch.io](https://leafguy.itch.io/magicode). To play the game, simply download the correct application for your machine, extract the zip file, and run the .app/.exe file.

## Source Code & Unity Install
This project was built in Unity v2022.3.50f1. If you're interested in taking a look behind the scenes, the folder entitled "Comps Game" contains all of the source code needed to build the game in Unity. Make sure to download the correct version from Unity Hub or [Unity's website](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.50#installs). From there, all thats left is to either download or clone this repository and open the folder in Unity.

## Comps Paper
The $\LaTeX$ files and PDF of my final paper detailing this projects design and evaluation can also be found in this repository. The folder entitled "Comps Paper" containes the $\LaTeX$ source.

## Game Design Document
An updated version of the Game Design Document can be found in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_b5wEkVmGLtPf5fN-9Ceo-iA9WFXOGoxdkHT31a4ILE/edit?usp=sharing). This doc also contains additional linked files to level and enemy planning documentation.

## Evaluation Data
As I conducted my playtests, I surveyed participants to gather quantitative data on their coding ability before and after playing the game, as well as qualitative data about their experience playing it. Though more concisely summarized in my paper, the surveys and raw data responses can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F7b50xaFvfE2F1knakdCm4rHaRKITp1pA6s78goNYoM/edit?resourcekey=&gid=77043153#gid=77043153).

## Poster
Putting this here just because I think it looks pretty. Check it out if you're curious, and picture me standing next to it and giving a 10-minute spiel about what my project is.

# Final Thoughts
This project was a lot of work, but honestly a great opportunity to put together a passion project. A lot about Magicode changed from its initial concept, and so many design ideas were scrapped for scope. I would love to come back to this eventually and take it even further -- implementing many of those ideas, touching up graphics, reworking levels, adding story sequences -- but for now, I rest. A million thank yous to everyone who supported me along the way, whether that was through early playtesting, giving feedback, or simply putting up with a very stressed version of me while I worked on this. Enjoy Magicode!
